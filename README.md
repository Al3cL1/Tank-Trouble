# Tank-Trouble
This is a simplified of the online game, "Tank Trouble", that Mario Solis, Chris Cox, Jun Ikeda and I designed for our final CS 3 project! The rules are simple. There are three players: the red player (using the awsd keys to move and the q key to shoot), the green player (using the ijkl keys to move and the u key to shoot), and the blue player (using the arrow keys to move and the space bar to shoot).
Explore the unique map generated on each level and find all 4 powerups: the railgun (red), the laser (maroon), the shotgun (gold), and the moon (gray)! But beware: rarely, a multiversal rupture causes controls to be changed. Have fun!

NOTE: Due to course policy, we are not allowed to publish the physics engine we built.
